# Foundry

**Foundry is a blazing fast, portable and modular toolkit for Ethereum application development written in Rust.**

Foundry consists of:

- **Forge**: Ethereum testing framework (like Truffle, Hardhat and DappTools).
- **Cast**: Swiss army knife for interacting with EVM smart contracts, sending transactions and getting chain data.
- **Anvil**: Local Ethereum node, akin to Ganache, Hardhat Network.
- **Chisel**: Fast, utilitarian, and verbose Solidity REPL.

üìä Gas Complexity Benchmarking: Analyzing Algorithm Efficiency in Web3

This report summarizes a benchmarking project using Foundry to evaluate the gas efficiency of classical sorting algorithms implemented in Solidity. Conducted by Saad (2022509) and Ahmed Ali Khan (2022054) at GIKI as part of the Design and Analysis of Algorithms course (CS378).

üîç Research Focus

We evaluated 5 sorting algorithms:
	‚Ä¢	Bubble Sort
	‚Ä¢	Insertion Sort
	‚Ä¢	Selection Sort
	‚Ä¢	Merge Sort
	‚Ä¢	Counting Sort

Objective: Understand how these algorithms perform in terms of gas consumption on the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), and how theoretical time complexity maps (or doesn‚Äôt) to on-chain performance.

‚öôÔ∏è Experimental Setup
	‚Ä¢	Blockchain Environment: Ethereum Mainnet Fork via Hardhat
	‚Ä¢	Tools Used: Foundry v0.2.0, Solidity 0.8.17
	‚Ä¢	Gas Measurement: Using gasleft() before and after execution
	‚Ä¢	Input Types: Arrays of unsigned integers (random, sorted, reversed)
	‚Ä¢	Input Sizes: 5 to 100 elements
	‚Ä¢	Validation: Deterministic inputs & multiple test runs

üß† Key Insights
	‚Ä¢	Counting Sort had the lowest gas cost for larger datasets despite higher space complexity.
	‚Ä¢	Theoretical O(n log n) algorithms like Merge Sort incurred extra gas due to recursion.
	‚Ä¢	Algorithms like Selection Sort and Insertion Sort performed more consistently on-chain due to predictable memory/storage behavior.

üìâ Sample Implementation (Selection Sort)

function selectionSort(uint[] memory arr) internal pure returns (uint[] memory) {
    uint n = arr.length;
    for (uint i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) {
        uint minIndex = i;
        for (uint j = i + 1; j < n; j++) {
            if (arr[j] < arr[minIndex]) {
                minIndex = j;
            }
        }
        if (minIndex != i) {
            uint temp = arr[i];
            arr[i] = arr[minIndex];
            arr[minIndex] = temp;
        }
    }
    return arr;
}

üìö Summary Table

Algorithm	Theoretical Complexity	EVM Gas Characteristics
Bubble Sort	O(n¬≤)	High storage writes
Counting Sort	O(n + k)	Memory-intensive, avoids in-place ops
Merge Sort	O(n log n)	Recursion gas overhead
Selection Sort	O(n¬≤)	Minimal memory, consistent performance
Insertion Sort	O(n¬≤)	Early termination helps reduce cost

üìå Conclusion

This work illustrates the gap between traditional algorithm analysis and blockchain environments. Web3 developers should benchmark in the EVM context instead of relying solely on Big-O notation when optimizing for gas cost.
